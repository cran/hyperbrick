Title: Accessory Tools for Preprocessing Hyper-Spectral Images
Version: 1.0
Date: 2022-03-29
Description: Read and execute preprocessing procedures on hyper-spectral images. 
    These type of sensor data are usually recorded in a raw format. This package
    contains some easy-to-use functions to promptly build the image with
    some basic radiometric calibrations, setting up the geographic information. 
    Geometric correction can be done with band-to-band registration (translation 
    and rotation). Further functionalities allow to compute sliding windows
    statistics over the image.
